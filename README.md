# Wave2Me-DCI-FinalProject
Idea of the Project:
The project Idea is to create a Page, which will help to learn Sign Language for People, who can hear but cannot understand Sign Language. Sign Language will help to communicate between People, who cannot hear and between People who can hear and cannot hear. Learning and knowing Sign Language is very important in this modern world. It is couple things why: young people are creating some Sign Language, which they are using to talk with each other; some signs we are using in daily life (for example traffic light, a ban on using the phone in one place or another and etc.). So, Sign Language is helping us to contact each other. And it is part of our social life which is very important for us.
Name of the Project:
The name of the project is “Wave to me” (shortly – w2m). Because our Project is about Sign Language, we tried to think in this Way. From Body language can we understand one or another Body speech: how can the Body show signs, what is saying Body for me and to other People (Dialog between me and you). “Wave” is the simple guest, which can be said or shown in many ways: guests, Body language, cultural differences, the closeness of friendship, or in politics (many Ways and signs to talk).
Team of the Project:
Our Team is 1. Allan Lufunda Chiyangi – Presentation; 2. Anne Mueni Musyoki – Front-end Developer; 3. Egle Jakonyte – Presentation; 4. Vonn Ryan Cruz – Front-end Developer; 5. Wojtek Urbanski – Project Leader and Full-Stack Developer.

About Us (Page Intro)
Thank you for visiting our website and also for downloading our app, you're the reason we made this. This app is designed, created, and developed by kind-hearted W2M members for beautiful people like you.
The app is our solution to what we consider a "good" problem: People want to understand, connect, express emotions or feelings, and learn more, and since not everyone has access to classes, by adding W2M to their language list, we wanted to take this into our hands and teach you Wave2Me sign language as if we're there with you in person.
Our goal is to give you the tools, such as everyday greetings or phrases, ways to pick up and keep a conversation going, and where/how you can start making connections between iconic signs to meaning, so you can hit the ground running and start talking with deaf people. We know for all of its complexities like any other language, one app is never enough to master a language, however, this is an opportunity for you to start the shift from vocal to a visual language.
Stay connected with us and others through sign language. Enjoy your learning experience, help us improve by giving us feedback, and don't forget to rate this app!
